## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 220, 60%, 50% (converted to #3385CC), suggesting trust and clarity in line with the app's problem-solving function. It is a bright, versatile choice contrasting well in light/dark schemes without being overbearing.
- Background color: HSL 220, 20%, 95% (converted to #F0F2F5) to support the primary color in a light color scheme, ensuring the interface is clean and focused, as fitting for a tool designed to solve problems quickly.
- Accent color: HSL 190, 70%, 40% (converted to #1AB2B2), to provide highlights without distracting from the primary function.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern and objective feel. This font is appropriate for both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro', a monospace font for displaying code snippets if necessary.
- Use clean, simple icons that visually represent the font identification process. The icons should be easily recognizable and consistent with the overall design.
- Subtle animations on font suggestion elements to provide feedback, for instance on the button that copies the font name to the clipboard.
